# Thrombolysis decisions

## Summary

This app uses pre-trained machine learning models 
that can be fed imaginary patient data.
The models output the predict the probability of each of 119 hospitals providing thrombolysis to the generated patient.

+ __Inputs:__ Patient details
+ __Outputs:__ Thrombolysis probability from each hospital.

For a summary of stroke and the motivation behind this research,
see the [SAMueL online book](https://samuel-book.github.io/samuel-1/introduction/intro.html).


## How to use this app

Go to the "Interactive demo" in the left sidebar.

To change between light mode and dark mode or to make the display wider, change the settings under the Menu in the top right of the screen.


### Limitations 

This app uses models that have been trained on synthetic data
that resembles real patient data for emergency stroke admissions in England and Wales.
As part of the training and checking the accuracy, this input data must include information about whether the 
patient was given thrombolysis.
The data is also restricted to the information on the SSNAP survey and 
cannot include any nuances or details gained from speaking to a patient and 
their family in person. 
As a result, this and similar models are not intended to be used as live prediction 
tools for deciding whether to give thrombolysis.

The intended use of this tool is for "what-if" scenarios,
for example: if this real patient had had a shorter arrival-to-scan time,
how much more likely would they have been to receive thrombolysis?
