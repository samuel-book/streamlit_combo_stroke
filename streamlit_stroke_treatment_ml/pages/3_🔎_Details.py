afib_anticoagulant_str = '''
When the patient is on anticoagulants, the "feature value" at the bottom is 1.
The average SHAP value is below -1.5 when the patient is on anticoagulants.
This means that the patient is considerably less likely to be treated
than if they were not on blood-thinning medication.
'''
age_str = '''
The average SHAP value decreases as age increases.
For patients below the age of 80, the SHAP value is positive and so
there is a small increase in the chance of thrombolysis.
For patients above the age of 80, the SHAP value is negative and becomes
more and more negative with increasing age. This reduces the chance of these
older patients receiving thrombolysis.
'''
arrival_to_scan_time_str = '''
The average SHAP value decreases as the time between arrival at hospital
and receiving a brain scan increases. 
On average, every extra 30 minutes decreases the SHAP value by around 0.5.
That means that after every hour on average, the chance of receiving
thrombolysis becomes three times smaller.
'''
infarction_str = '''
When the "feature value" at the bottom is 1, the patient has an infarction
which is also called a blood clot. When the patient does not have a blood clot,
the average SHAP value is very negative at around minus 9. This means that
the chance of being given thrombolysis becomes very small. This reflects how
in real life, clot-busting drugs should not be given when there is no clot.
'''
onset_during_sleep_str = '''
When the "feature value" at the bottom is 1, the patient\'s stroke began
while they were asleep. This means that the exact time that the stroke
started is less accurately known, and so the chance of their being treated
with thrombolysis is reduced considerably. The average SHAP value in this
case is below minus 1.
'''
onset_to_arrival_time_str = '''
The average SHAP value decreases as the time between the start of the stroke and
the arrival at hospital increases. Patients arriving before 120 minutes are
slightly more likely to receive treatment. Patients arriving after 120 minutes
are slightly less likely to receive treatment.
'''
precise_onset_known_str = '''
When the "feature value" at the bottom is 0, the time that the stroke started
is not known precisely. The average SHAP value in this case is almost minus 1.
This makes the patient somewhat less likely to receive thrombolysis.
'''
prior_disability_str = '''
As the prior disability score increases, the average SHAP value decreases.
This means that patients who had a higher level of disability before the
stroke began are somewhat less likely to be treated than patients with
no pre-stroke disability.
'''
stroke_severity_str = '''
In this chart, each separate score for stroke severity has its own box.
The average SHAP value is negative for low scores below 5
and for high scores above 32. For scores between those values,
the average SHAP value is positive. This means that the most mild and the
most severe strokes are somewhat less likely to be treated with thrombolysis,
and the most moderate strokes are somewhat more likely to be treated 
with thrombolysis.

### How do you read a waterfall plot?
 
The waterfall plot has a number of rows. Each row is labelled with a patient detail name, and each row contains a coloured block. The blocks show the effect of that patient detail on the overall probability of receiving thrombolysis. Larger blocks mean a larger effect. The size of the effect is also written next to each block.

Always start at the top at the place marked "start probability". Then move downwards row by row, adding or removing probability, until you reach the bottom of the plot. The "end probability" that you are left with after adding on the effect of all of the coloured blocks is the overall probability of thrombolysis for this patient.

The features are ordered from largest negative effect on probability to largest positive effect. The 9 largest features are shown individually and the rest are condensed into the "other features" bar. This bar mostly contains the effect of the patient _not_ attending the other stroke teams.

The wizard hat plot is so named because the resulting lines look like the shape of a wonky crooked cartoon wizard's hat.
            
The plot combines the data in all of the separate stroke teams' SHAP waterfall plots.
            
### How do you read a wizard's hat plot?

This plot should be read in the same way as a waterfall plot. Start at the top and work downwards row by row, shifting the "probability so far" in each row left or right a bit depending on the patient details.
            
Instead of drawing coloured blocks to show the shifts in probability, this graph simply connects the points with a straight line. Each stroke team gets one coloured line that runs from the top row to the bottom row.
            
There are so many lines that it is difficult to follow the progress of individual teams unless they are highlighted in a different colour. This means that the graph is best used to get an idea of how the patient details affect the probability of treatment for the different stroke teams.
            
The features are ordered with the most agreed on features at the top, and the ones with more variation lower down.

The violin plot shows the distribution of values across all stroke teams. These values are usually the probabilities of receiving thrombolysis.

### How do you read a violin plot?

The range of possible values is shown from left to right. The violin is fatter where there are more stroke teams with that value. Usually there are one or two values that most of the teams are close to and so the violin will appear fattest there. 

The black lines show the smallest, average (median) and largest probabilities out of all of the teams.

### What does this example show?

The top row shows that most of the teams have a probability above 80%. The violin is fattest around 85% to 95% and so most of the values lie in that range. 

We also have separate rows for only the benchmark and only the non-benchmark teams. There are 25 benchmark teams and 94 non-benchmark teams. Since most of the "all teams" row is made up of non-benchmark teams, the non-benchmark teams violin is usually similar in shape to the all team violin.

The middle row shows only the benchmark teams. The probabilities here are more squashed up towards the right-hand-side, with most lying between 90% to 100%. This means that generally the benchmark teams result in higher probabilities than you generally see in all of the teams or in only the non-benchmark teams.

### What do the circle markers mean?

For the plots like in this example, the circle markers on top of the violins mark the values for any teams that have been highlighted. 

There is no meaning behind how high up or low down the circle markers appear. They are moved up or down to reduce the overlap between circles with a similar place on the graph.

üí´ _More detail:_
+ A plain English summary of machine learning models: [here](https://samuel-book.github.io/samuel-2/samuel_shap_paper_1/introduction/intro.html)

The decision model is a type of machine learning model called an XGBoost Classifier.
We start off with a base model that has never been shown any data but is ready to learn.
Then we give this model the training data set.
The model goes through each patient in turn and decides whether or not they should receive thrombolysis.

At first the model does an awful job because it doesn't have much experience.
As the model sees more and more patients, it learns more about the general patterns that affect how likely patients are to be treated.
When the model has seen all of the patients in the training data set, it has become quite accurate.
Whether it says the patient would receive thrombolysis usually matches the actual case in real life.

We use a set of testing data from the real-life patient data set. For this data we know whether each patient received thrombolysis in real life. We can pass that data to the decision model to predict whether each patient was thrombolysed, and then see how often the prediction matched reality.

(To do - write about the more robust checks including ROC-AUC.)

### Creating the SHAP explainer model

The SHAP explainer model is created directly from the decision model. 

We actually create two SHAP explainers. 
+ One uses only the decision model and works in units of log-odds. These units are technically more useful than simple probabilities, but they are also more difficult to understand intuitively. This model is used to define the benchmark teams.
