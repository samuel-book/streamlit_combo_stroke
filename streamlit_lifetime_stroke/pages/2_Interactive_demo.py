"""
Interactive demo for Streamlit.

This script runs through everything from receiving user inputs
for age, sex, and mRS, to calculating all the quantities we need
for tables and charts of mortality, QALYs, resource use, and
cost effectiveness.

Most of the proper calculation functions are in main_calculations.py,
and most of the calls to write to streamlit are in the scripts
named container_(something).py.
