# OptImIST: OPTimising IMplementation of Ischaemic Stroke Thrombectomy

This app is part of the [OptImIST](https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR202361) project, which is funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).
This app was developed alongside a paper (McMeekin et al., _in prep._), which will be linked here when it's available. 

The following plain English summary of OptImIST is copied from [the funding award](https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR202361).


## Plain English Summary

__Aims:__ Our Programme aims to evaluate a new way to access a life-changing emergency procedure for stroke patients which is only available in regional Centres. There are two Research Questions: 
1) Should specialists at regional Centres select ambulance patients to divert to their Centre instead of the nearest local Stroke Unit? 
2) How can each region in England achieve the most cost-effective emergency stroke treatment? 

__Background:__ Stroke is the commonest cause of adult disability. Approximately 1 in 10 patients are suitable for an emergency procedure to remove blood clots blocking large arteries in the brain (known as thrombectomy) which greatly improves their chances of recovery. In England, this procedure is available at 24 regional Centres with specialist facilities, but most stroke patients are first admitted to 108 local Stroke Units. Patients suitable for the procedure need emergency transfer to a regional Centre, which typically delays treatment by 90 minutes and reduces its benefit. Faster treatment might occur if patients could attend Centres directly rather than local Units, but no accurate assessment or portable test exists to guide ambulance staff. However, staff collect information during routine care which could start a process to find and quickly treat suitable patients. 

__Design:__ 
+ For Research Question 1 we will firstly summarise existing evidence about remote assessment of suspected stroke patients and collect opinions from ambulance and hospital teams to develop a new specialist prehospital redirection pathway. The pathway will involve ambulance staff triggering a remote review of suspected stroke patients by a hospital specialist, who then selects which patients should go directly to the nearest Centre. To find out whether the pathway is beneficial, a clinical trial will then be conducted. Patients with a suspected stroke will receive either the new pathway or standard care. Data describing treatment delivery will be compared between these two groups. Experiences and views about the pathway will be collected during patient and clinician interviews. 
+ For Research Question 2, advanced computer models will calculate how to provide the most cost-effective treatment. The models will combine geographical, healthcare and trial data with stakeholder views and other published evidence describing selection of stroke patients for emergency treatment. 

__Patient and public involvement:__ The project team includes a stroke survivor to provide service user perspectives into the routine management of the Programme. Public volunteers from each clinical service involved in the trial will meet regularly as a Programme PPI Partnership Group to review progress and provide advice to the researchers. 

__Dissemination:__ Research reports will be published in journals and findings included in National Clinical Guidelines for hospitals and ambulance services. We will also use NHS Integrated Stroke Delivery Networks and professional societies to distribute reports. Stroke survivor networks will receive easily accessible versions.
