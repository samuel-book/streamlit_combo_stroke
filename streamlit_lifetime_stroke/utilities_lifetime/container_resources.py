    Inputs:
    -------
    df                    - pd.DataFrame. Contains all of the calculated
                            results for all mRS scores.
    mrs_input             - int. The mRS score to highlight in areas
                            that only show one score's results.
    fixed_params          - dict. Contains fixed parameters independent
                            of the model results.
    table_discounted_cost - np.array. The table of discounted cost by
                            change in outcome, ready to print.
    model_type_used       - str. Whether this is the separate "mRS" or
                            "Dichotomous" model. Used to change the
                            formatting in the app for model type.
