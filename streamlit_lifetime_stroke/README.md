The app takes user inputs to select the age, sex, and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score on discharge from hospital following a stroke, and these are used to calculate the following quantities across the remainder of that patient's lifespan:
+ The probability of survival of the patient in each year.
+ The number of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).
+ The expected use of resources (e.g. number of admissions to A&E and number of years spent in residential care) and the cost of those resources.
+ The discounted total net benefit by change in mRS score. 

The topics of the pages in the app follow the recommendations of ["Improving the usability of open health service delivery simulation models using Python and web apps"](https://openresearch.nihr.ac.uk/articles/3-48/v1).
