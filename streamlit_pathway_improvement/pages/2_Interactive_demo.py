            Each stroke team has a different set of patient statistics.
            These include proportions, for example how many patients
            have known onset times, and distributions, for example
            the expected values of arrival-to-scan times.

            We calculate the results for a stroke team by
            simulating many cohorts of patients attending the team.
            We use one cohort per year and the number of patients in
            a cohort is the same as the average number of admissions
            to the stroke team in a year.
            The proportions of patients who have LVOs and nLVOs are
            also drawn from the average hospital data.

            The random elements in the simulation include whether a patient
            meets certain criteria, for example whether the onset time
            is known, and the specific timings chosen for a patient,
            which are usually drawn from a distribution of times.
            This means that two cohorts will contain different data.

            The pre-stroke mRS scores for the patients are generated by
            randomly selecting a "fixed probability" for each patient.
            The method from the "Outcome measure" tab shows how this is
            converted to post-stroke mRS scores.

            The simulations run for 100 years per team and the results
            below are the average results across the 100 trials.
