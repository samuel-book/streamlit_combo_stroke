### Stroke types

Patients can have an ischaemic stroke, which is caused by a blood clot, or 
a haemorrhaegic stroke, which is caused by a bleed in the brain. 

Ischaemic stroke can be further defined by the location of the clot, which is either:

+ a large-vessel occlusion (__LVO__), or 
+ a non-large-vessel occlusion (__nLVO__).
''')

with cols_stroke_types[1]:
    st.markdown('''
### Treatments
There are two types of treatment available for ischaemic stroke. Both of these aim to achieve reperfusion, which is the restoration of the blood supply to the cut-off areas of the brain. 

Treatments:
+ intravenous thrombolysis (__IVT__), a clot-busting medication.
+ mechanical thrombectomy (__MT__), which physically removes the clot.

Limitations:
+ Patients with an LVO can be treated with IVT and/or MT. 
+ Patients with an nLVO can be treated with IVT. 

The benefit received by the patient decreases with time, with each treatment having no effect after a specified duration (6.3 hours for IVT, and 8 hours for MT).
