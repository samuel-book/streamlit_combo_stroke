In this demo we will compare the expected outcomes for two cases. All of the patients will share a timeline, including factors such as the travel times to the nearest hospitals and the times between arrival at the hospital and receiving the appropriate treatment. 

We have invented a scenario where there is a choice of two hospitals for the patients to travel to. One of these can only provide IVT, while the other provides both IVT and MT.
