# SAMueL-2: Stroke Audit and Machine Learning 2.

The stroke outcome models are part of SAMueL-2, (Stroke Audit and Machine Learning 2). More details about SAMueL-2 generally are available at the [online book](https://samuel-book.github.io/samuel-2/), and our published papers, presentations and other useful documents are available at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/samuel-book/samuel-2-reference). 

For an overview on SAMueL and our results so far:

SAMueL-2 is part of the Peninsula Collaboration for Health Operational Research and Data Science [PenCHORD](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/research-and-implementation/research-teams/penchord/).

The stroke outcome model will also be used in other projects, including OPTIMIST (OPTimising IMplementation of Ischaemic Stroke Thrombectomy).
