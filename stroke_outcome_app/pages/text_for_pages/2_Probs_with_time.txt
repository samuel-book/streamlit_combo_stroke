The mRS probability distributions are a concoction of [various sources of data](https://samuel-book.github.io/samuel-2/outcome_modelling/mRS_datasets_full.html).
The boundaries between the mRS bins follow [the shape of a logistic function](https://samuel-book.github.io/samuel-2/outcome_modelling/mRS_outcomes_maths.html).
