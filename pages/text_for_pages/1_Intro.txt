### Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and utility-weighted mRS

Disability levels may be measured in various ways. In this project we are using the modified Rankin Scale (__mRS__). It is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.

In addition to mRS, we may calculate utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS). UW-mRS incorporates both treatment effect and patient perceived quality of life as a single outcome measure for stroke trials. UW-mRS scores are based on a pooled analysis of 20,000+ patients, from Wang et al. (2020). 

| mRS Score | Utility | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.97 | No symptoms. |
| 1 | 0.88 | No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms. |
| 2 | 0.74 | Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities. |
| 3 | 0.55 | Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted. |
| 4 | 0.20 | Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted. |
| 5 | -0.19 | Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent. |
| 6 | 0.00 | Dead. |
