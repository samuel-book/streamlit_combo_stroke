### SAMueL

The SAMueL-3 project is currently in progress. It is expanding on SAMueL-2 by introducing thrombectomy and following patients beyond the acute stroke phase, for example the number of days spent in care in the year after stroke.
SAMueL-3 is the follow-up to SAMuEL-2 and SAMueL-1, which have been completed.

More details about SAMueL-2 generally are available at the [online book](https://samuel-book.github.io/samuel-2/), and our published papers, presentations and other useful documents are available at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/samuel-book/samuel-2-reference).
